# Capstone-Project-Fraud-Detection-and-Customer-Analysis-in-E-commerce
This project explores customer behavior and transaction data from an e-commerce platform ([dataset source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/fraudulent-e-commerce-transactions)) to achieve two key goals:
1. Fraud Detection: by developing a model using logistic regression to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions based on customer and purchase characteristics ([can be found here](https://github.com/soholade/Capstone-Project-Fraud-Detection-and-Customer-Analysis-in-E-commerce/blob/main/Logistic_Regression_Model_for_Predicting_Fraudulent_E_Commerce_Transactions.ipynb));
2. Customer Segmentation: by analyzing customer behavior through techniques like RFM analysis and cohort analysis to understand customer segments ([analysis dashboard can be found here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/monika.samuolyte/viz/UsingCustomerAnalyticstoEnhanceE-commerceSecurity-dashboard/Story1)).
